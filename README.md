Mohr's circle is a graphical method used in engineering to represent and analyze the stress state at a point within a material under different loadings.
In my role as a structural engineer I often use global analysis software to determine the maximum stresses in each different member type, i.e column, beam, etc.
The sectional properties of the members are checked aganst these maximum stresses. The standard practise within the company is to use Tekla Tedds Structural Analysis Software.  

This program was created a stress analysis calculator alternative to Tekla Tedds software.

This code graphically represents the state of stress at a single point, from this the following is calculated:
1) the principal stresses,
2) orientation of the principal planes,
3) maximum shear stresses,
4) the orientation of the maximum shear stress planes
5) and the stresses on any other pair of orthogonal planes.
